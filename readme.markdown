Sage is a comprehensive, modular and extensible XML/XSLT framework running on top of ASP.NET MVC, featuring extensive internationalization capabilities.
It provides powerful tools for rapid web development, both on the back and the front end, while trying to stay out of the way and without trying to change the way you work.
