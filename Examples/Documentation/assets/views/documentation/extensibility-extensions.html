			<h3 class="section">Developing</h3>

			<p>
				As a type of Sage project, extension projects can have any combination of controllers, modules, views and other
				resources. The extension project itself can be worked on independently and the extension project itself provides
				the text/example project of the extension.
			</p>
			<p>
				The <a href="${url:link(configuration-project)}">project configuration</a> specifies which of the extensions components
				and resources should be copied into the deliverable archive. This allows extension developers to mix other work
				items, such as test views and specifications with the deliverable code, and filter them out in the compile step.
			</p>

			<h3 class="section">Packaging</h3>

			<p>
				The extension projects are packaged by the <code>Sage.Build</code> utility, invoked from the command line.
				Relative paths are considered relative to the working directory.
			</p>

			<code class="principal">
				sage.build extension -source:&lt;extension-project-path&gt; -target:&lt;path-to-archive&gt;
			</code>

			<h3 class="section">Consuming</h3>

			<p>
				The extension archives are placed in the extensions directory of the target project. With each initialization
				of the application, the extension will be registered with the project.
