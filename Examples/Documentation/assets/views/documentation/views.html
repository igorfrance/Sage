						At the core of the Sage framework is a streamlined, powerful and extensible XML view engine with an easy and familiar top layer written simply as XHTML.

							<p>
								To make the develoment as natural as possible for a frontend developer, the views are typically written as plain XHTML files. The XHTML views are treated as XML files with elements from <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace. When requested, the view is transformed using it's corresponding XSLT stylesheet. The result of that transformation is sent to the response; that's typically the HTML that the user agent receives.

							<p>
								The complete process is actually more complicated than that, the <a href="${xml-flow}">document transform flow</a> section provides more in-depth information about additional background processing steps performed by Sage.

						They don't pursue drawing the perfect
						UML model in a case tool, writing the perfect requirements document, or
						writing code that will be able to accommodate all imaginable future
						changes. Instead, Scrum and XP teams focus on getting things done.
						These teams accept that they may mistakes along the way, but they also
						realize that the best way to find those mistakes is to stop thinking about
						the software at the theoretical level of analysis and design and to dive in,
						get their hands dirty, and start building the product.

							Both Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) ask teams to complete some
							tangible piece of shippable work by the end of each iteration. These
							iterations are designed to be short and timeboxed. This focus on
							delivering working code in a short timeframe means that Scrum and XP
							teams don't have time for theories.

						Scrum worked! For us at least (meaning my current client in Stockholm,
						who's name I don't intend to mention here). Hope it will work for you
						too! Maybe this paper will help you along the way.
