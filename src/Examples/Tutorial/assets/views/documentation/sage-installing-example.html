		<p>
			This Sage project is included as an example project within the archive that can be download from the
			<a sage:attrib="href:url(sage-obtaining)">sage build server</a>. Downloaded and installed, this example should
			look just like this website (there may be minor differences if the version is different).
		</p>
		<p>
			Prior to installing a Sage project on your server, make sure you have the following installed:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IIS 7 or higher</li>
			<li>.NET framework 4.0 or higher</li>
			<li>ASP.NET MVC 2 or higher</li>
			<li>Microsoft Code Contracts (this might not be necessary, testing needed)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Then proceed with the following steps:
		</p>
		<ol class="separate">
			<li>
				Extract the contents of <a sage:attrib="href:url(sage-obtaining)">sage.tutorial.zip</a> to a directory on your
				server.
			</li>
			<li>
				Create a new website and set it's directory to the directory where you extracted the archive in the previous
				step. Alternatively, a Sage project can also be configured as a virtual directory if required, but typically
				a project will be configured as a website.
			</li>
			<li>
				Navigate to your website, the homepage should appear.
			</li>
		</ol>
