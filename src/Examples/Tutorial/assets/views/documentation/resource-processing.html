			Sage provides several resource processing featured useful in web application development.

				<p>
					A larger number of reasonably small, reusable and well-organized files is often more maintable then single large files.
					Developers frequently organize their scripts and styles in many separate documents, organized in
					various ways. A moderately complex web page can easily end up with 20+ individual scripts or stylesheets that
					all need to be loaded for the page to be fully functional.
				</p>
				<p>
					The downside of using this approach is that for each of these files, there will be an additional latency
					added to each of these files' request. That is, for each file the browser has to make a separate request,
					and wait for the reponse from the server. This results in slower loading times than in scenarios where all
					scripts and styles arrive in one or two larger responses. The more separate files are used, the bigger the
					hit will be; and conversely, the bigger will the speed gain be if the files are served together with fewer
					requests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sage solves this problem using fluid resource inclusion to merge separate scripts and styles into single files,
					and conditionally outputting them back as separate requests during development.

			<dt><a href="url(resource-processing-compression)">JavaScript and CSS minification</a></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Another way to optimize the total size of web pages, and by extension also the speed of the page itself, is to minify the files
					we serve; that is, to strip them of any unnecessary comments and white-space that we use to make them more readable for
					humans, and send back to the browser just the raw code that it needs. Advanced minifiers can also optionally rename variable
					and functions to shorter names, reducing the file sizes even further.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar to the situation with merging, we want our resources to be formatted and human readable during development,
					and fully compressed and optimized on production for delivery to general public.
				</p>
				<p>
					Sage uses the <a href="url(sage-libraries)">AjaxMin library</a> for minification, and provides configuration
					through <code>Web.config</code>. <a href="url(resource-processing-compression)">Find out more</a>.

			<dt><a href="url(resource-processing-imaging)">Inline image manipulation</a></dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
					Images can be manipulated inline, simply by appending a few query string parameters to the end on an image
					request. These parameters specify the filters to apply as well as any of their associated configuration values.
