		<p>
			Dividing the code in small, reusable and well-organized files help keep our development maintanable, much in the
			spirit of "Divide and Conquer".
		</p>
		<p>
			The downside of this approach is that since each of these resources needs to be accessed individually, there is
			some latency added to each request and the overall experience of the site will be slower than if all of those
			resources were to be in the same file, where possible. And the more resources there are, the more noticable this
			difference will be.
		</p>
		<p>
			The approach Sage uses is to use <a href="url(kelp)" class="tooltip" title="This is some great text">Kelp</a> to open files that may be merged, and depending on
			whether the <a href="url(configuration-project)">project is configured</a> to merge resources or not to output
			a single script element with everything merged, or to output individual script elements for all resources that
			have been merged in the source file.
		</p>
		<p>
			This makes it possible to have all scripts and stylesheets served as individual resources during development,
			and have them all merged when the project gets deployed to production, simply by changing a configuration property.
