		<p>
			The main project configuration file, <code>Project.config</code>, contains many settings that control how the
			application behaves during runtime.
		</p>

		<h3 class="section">Configuration files</h3>

		<p>
			There are three types of different project configuration files, with unique file and element names. The
			structure of these files is exactly the same (with the exception for extension configuration, which provides
			one additional element), but the usage and application is different.
		</p>

		<blockquote>

			<h4 class="section">Project.config</h4>

			<p>
				This is the main project configuration file that is specific to the current project. Any values not specified
				in this file will be used from system configuration file, if it exists. When a project initializes
			</p>

			<h4 class="section">System.config</h4>

			<p>
				This is another project configuration file, containing the default values. This configuration file is provided
				by Sage, and serves to provide defaults. This approach enables specific project configurations to be smaller,
				freeing them from having to specify everything explicitly.
			</p>

			<h4 class="section">Extension.config</h4>

			<p>
				The extension configuration file is actually a regular project configuration file that is modified and packed
				as <code>Extension.config</code> info the deliverable archive when an
				<a href="url:link(extensibility-extensions)">extension project</a> is compiled into an
				extension. One additional element that an extension project's configuration file contains is the
				<a href="url:self(?package=2)">package element</a>, that specifies how the extension should be packed into the
				archive.
			</p>

		</blockquote>

		<h3 class="section">Configuration elements</h3>

		<p>
			The following elements appear in any order within <code>project</code>, <code>extension</code> or <code>system</code>
			configuration files.
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<ul class="separate">
				<li>
					<h5 class="casual">project | extension | system</h5>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</blockquote>
