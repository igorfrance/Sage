				<p>
					Another way to optimize the total size of web pages, and by extension also the speed of the page itself, is to minify the files
					we serve; that is, to strip them of any unnecessary comments and white-space that we use to make them more readable for
					humans, and send back to the browser just the raw code that it needs. Advanced minifiers can also optionally rename variable
					and functions to shorter names, reducing the file sizes even further.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar to the situation with merging, we want our resources to be formatted and human readable during development,
					and fully compressed and optimized on production for delivery to general public.

					Sage uses the <a href="url(sage-libraries)">AjaxMin library</a> for minification, and provides configuration
					through <code>Web.config</code>. <a href="url(resource-processing-compression)">Find out more</a>.
