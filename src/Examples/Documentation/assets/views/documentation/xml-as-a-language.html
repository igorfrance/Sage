			<p>
				XML, by it's very nature lends itself perfectly to extensibility. When XHTML specification was initially developed,
				the motivation was to make HTML more extensible and to increase interoperability with other data formats.
				With it's advent, many developers imagined a future where HTML could be extended with new XML tags that provide
				additional functionality, and a web where pages would parse as valid XML and their content could be programmatically
				accessed using XML DOM and other APIs.
			</p>
			<p>
				Neither of these came to be, not de-facto anyway. Browsers are very forgiving in their markup parsing and nothing
				has been done to enable extending HTML with additional tags across all browsers in a standards-compatible way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sage guarantees HTML markup that parses as valid XML, and it provides a fair number of additional XML tags that can
				be used in XHTML. It's also very easy to create new custom sets of tags with even more functionality.

				The following section lists all namespaces in use or available for use in Sage.
