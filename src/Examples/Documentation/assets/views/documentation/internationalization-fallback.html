		<p>
			When selecting which localized file to open, which elements to render and which dictionary phrase or variable
			value to substitute, Sage goes through locale fallback process from high to low priority until a match is found.
		</p>
		<p>
			This approach allows creating configurations that have any number of base locales for fall back to and if desired,
			to have one locale that is the base locale for all others.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fallback paths are defined in <a sage:attrib="href:url(configuration-project)">project configuration</a>
			for each locale separately through attributes <code>dictionaryNames</code> and <code>resourceNames</code>.
		</p>

		<dl class="section">
			<dt>name</dt>
			<dd>
				Each locale must use the required attribute <code>name</code>, and while this name can be set as required, it's
				value must be unique.
			</dd>
			<dt>dictionaryNames</dt>
			<dd>
				The attribute <code>dictionaryNames</code> specifies the names (comma-separated) of dictionary files that can be
				used with that locale, where the names should be ordered by priority, from most to least specific.
			</dd>
			<dt>resourceNames</dt>
			<dd>
				The attribute <code>resourceNames</code> specifies the names (comma-separated) of locale suffixes that can be
				used with that locale, where the names should be ordered by priority, from most to least specific.
			</dd>
		</dl>

		<h2 class="section">Dictionary names</h2>

		<p>
			When Sage <a sage:attrib="href:url(internationalization-phrases)">substitutes phrases</a> during the
			<a sage:attrib="href:url(xml-flow-localize)">localization step</a>, it replaces the phrase reference nodes with
			the actual values of referenced phrases. The phrases are defined in language dictionaries, and dictionaries can
			be combined to facilitate reuse.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sage will construct a dynamic dictionary for each locale, which is a combination of dictionaries as specified with
			the locale's associated <code>dictionaryNames</code> attribute.
		</p>
		<p>
			The value of <code>dictionaryNames</code> attribute specifies the dictionaries that can be used for that locale,
			ordered from most to least specific dictionary.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sage will start by creating a base dictionary by copying all phrases from the least specific dictionary. It will
			then proceed and open each of the more specific dictionaries and copy all phrases into the base dictionary, either
			appending them (those phrases that do not exist in the base) or replacing the phrases from the base dictionary
			with phrases from more specific dictionary (for those phrases that exist in both).
		</p>
		<p>
			And finally, with this complete version of the dictionary the resource is translated into the corresponding locale.
		</p>

		<h2 class="section">Resource names</h2>

		<p>
			Attribute <code>resourceNames</code> is semantically similar to <code>dictionaryNames</code> in that it specifies
			a comma-separated list of locales, ordered from most to least specific, that can be used with this locale. One
			additional thing to note about this attribute is the use of the locale 'default', which always needs to be the
			last locale in this list. This name stands for <i>no suffix</i>, the version without a specific locale.
		</p>

		<h5 class="section">When opening files</h5>
		<p>
			When opening XML resources during the <a sage:attrib="href:url(xml-flow-localize)">localization step</a>, Sage
			will attempt to add each of locale names specified with the <code>resourceNames</code> attribute as a suffix of
			the base name, and if it finds a file with that suffix it will be used instead of the requested base name.
		</p>
		<p>
			For instance, if the configuration example above, locale <b>ar</b> specifies resourceNames <b>ar, la, es, default</b>.
			This means that if we request a file <code>~/assets/views/home/index.html</code> in locale <b>ar</b>, the system
			will check for presence of each of these suffixes, and return the first version that exists:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>~/assets/views/home/index-<b>ar</b>.html (<b>Argentina</b>)</li>
			<li>~/assets/views/home/index-<b>la</b>.html (<b>Latin America</b>)</li>
			<li>~/assets/views/home/index-<b>es</b>.html (<b>Spain</b>)</li>
			<li>~/assets/views/home/index.html (<b>Generic</b>)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The same selection mechanism can be used on all resources in the project by configuring the project to use the
			<a sage:attrib="href:url(configuration-rewriters)">LocalizePathRewriter</a>.
		</p>

		<h5 class="section">When localizing documents</h5>
		<p>
			When Sage is <a sage:attrib="href:url(internationalization-variables)">resolving variable values</a> during the
			<a sage:attrib="href:url(xml-flow-localize)">localization step</a>, it
			will attempt to resolve the value by going through the same list of locale names specified with the
			<code>resourceNames</code> attribute, and return the value of the first matching locale.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Sage is <a sage:attrib="href:url(internationalization-conditionals)">resolving which elements to render</a> during the
			<a sage:attrib="href:url(xml-flow-localize)">localization step</a>, it goes through the list of locales specified
			by the conditional block, and if any one of the locales if found in the list of specified with the <code>resourceNames</code>
			attribute for the current locale, the block will be rendered.
