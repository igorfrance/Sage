		<p>
			Sage supports inclusion of JavaScript and CSS files, using a special comment syntax that instructs the file handler
			on which file to include in place of the comment that has been used. This makes it possible to have single files
			that include whole libraries of separate files together as one file to the browser.
		</p>

		<p>
			Serving as few files as possible is a common performance optimization strategy, and in that light it is convenient
			that the source code we like to keep in separate, organized files gets served to the cliet as a single file
			automatically.
		</p>

		<h3 class="section">Production</h3>

		<p>
			In production, all included resources are served back as one file. The file might also be automatically minified upon fist
			request, depending on how the web application <a href="url:link(configuration-compression)">has been configured</a>.
			After processing (merging and compressing), the file is cached indefinitely on disk from where subsequent requests
			are being served. The cached file gets regenerated only if one of its constituents is updated, or on explicit demand.
		</p>

		<h3 class="section">Development</h3>

		<p>
			During development, Sage can be made aware of merged scripts and will deliver all of the constituent files as separate
			resources to aid in development and enable debugging and stepping through code.

		<h3 class="section">Usage</h3>

		<p>
			By <a href="link:url(configuration-handlers)">configuring a <code>Kelp</code> handler,</a> for JavaScript and CSS files,
			other Javascript or CSS files to be included can then be referenced simply by using a special
			comment syntax to specify their location relaitive to the including file.
		</p>

		<mod:SyntaxHighlighter>
			<mod:config>
				<mod:language>javascript</mod:language>
				<mod:code>
					/*# Include: relative/path.js */
					var x = 10;
				</mod:code>
			</mod:config>
		</mod:SyntaxHighlighter>

		<mod:SyntaxHighlighter>
			<mod:config>
				<mod:language>css</mod:language>
				<mod:code>
					/*# Include: relative/path.css */
					body
						{ background-color: #444; color: #ccc; font-size: 100%; }
				</mod:code>
			</mod:config>
		</mod:SyntaxHighlighter>

		<p>
			The handler will process these files and automatically insert the reference content.
		</p>
